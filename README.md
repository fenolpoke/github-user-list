# github-user-list
Scrolled 100 first user of github

The App is developed in Java 8, with minimum requirement of Jelly Bean android OS.

Since default github API can only request 30 user at a time, the request was done repeatedly until reaching limit of 100. :(
The ideal case was to load 30 every time the scrolling reached the bottom.

If you clicked on the list item, the user detail will be shown.

No pagination.
